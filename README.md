## HTML/CSS challenge project #3

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. It's based on the design brief and supplied mockups found at [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

I'm working through these challenges to solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS, familiarise myself with a typical front end web developer's workflow, and get comfortable with using git and github. Aside from the design mockups, a style guide and images obtained from the link above, the HTML and CSS here is entirely my own work.

This challenge was quite straightforward, with a couple of flexboxes and a media query being all that was required to achieve the desired responsive layout.
